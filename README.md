This is practice writing a RoR application.

Vanilla-bean is a teeny tiny application for estate planning.
Based on watching the most recent 2023 just vanilla webinair and reading the about page,
this app is trying to mimic just vanilla functionality.

My mini vanilla-bean can do the following:
- [ ] An advisor can plan multiple estates and has many clients
- [ ] Add key information about the family and financial information
- [ ] Create diagrams based on family and financial information
